## Often the simulation loops infinitely, it seems like this war will never end... :D
## There are out of range errors if a war occurs when one player does not have enough cards to partake in one.

#I am going to attempt to do this recursively (ish), and plan for a GUI as well. Lets do this properly ;)
#On top of that, I think we should work on turning this into a full game, and releasing it too.
#I can do all the paperwork, although help with the short design documents would be appreciated
